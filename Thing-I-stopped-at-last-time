    - hasn't added courseList
    - need a courseList : populate at the start of program
    - is wondering: "Prints all courses offered in 1 semester." - I guess this is a separate function from the
    courseList.

    -ask teacher:
            a. The method: "add, update, delete, getOne, getAll" according to which attributes (student, course or
            semester)?
            b. Is the "add, update" methods the same as the funtionality listed in bold
            sentence?

            c. What we save in report CSV is what the console prints out, or the command the user calls?

    - enrollList in 'CsvHandle', how and should I find way to allow only 1 object of CsvHandle (so that there won't be
    multiple enrollLists)

    - currently having problem with enrollList (does not know the connection of enrollList between classes).
